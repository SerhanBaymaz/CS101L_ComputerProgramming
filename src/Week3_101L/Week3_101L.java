         2. The two roots of a quadratic equation 𝑎𝑥2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0 can be obtained using the following
        formula:
         is called the discriminant of the quadratic equation. If it is positive, the equation has
        two real roots. If it is zero, the equation has one root. If it is negative, the equation has no real
        roots.
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter values for a, b and c and displays the result
        based on the discriminant. If the discriminant is positive, display two rotos. If the discriminant is
        0, display one root. Otherwise, display “The equation has no real roots”.
